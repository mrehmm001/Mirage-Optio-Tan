This repository contains my attempt at iwoca's take-home assessment. Despite my best efforts to implement the solution correctly, I was ultimately rejected. The feedback I received was that "it would have been better to increase the page on each API call instead of increasing the limit." 

I found this feedback to be quite unfair and unhelpful. The Figma mockup clearly shows a "Load More" button, and typically, from a user's expectation, a "Load More" button would increase the limit to display more information, rather than paginating. If pagination was the intended approach, it would have been helpful for the mockups to include pagination buttons instead of the "Load More" button.

Nevertheless, I don't want my hard work to go to waste, so Iâ€™m making this repository public. To anyone at iwoca reading this, I hope this serves as feedback to consider making future assessments clearer and more fairer.



## iwoca frontend interview test (application portal)

### Setup

1. Clone this repo to your local machine, its a project created using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
1. Make sure you are using the correct node version:
   1. Manually: `node -v` should return `18.16.0`
   1. If you don't have Node version manager (NVM) [install install it from here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
   1. Using `nvm`: Run `nvm install` to install the node version and `nvm use` to use it
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
1. Run `npm start` to start the `frontend` on `localhost:3000` and the api server on `localhost:3001`

### The Task

Currently there is only one application which is shown using a hard coded JSON fixture in the codebase

The applications api http://localhost:3001/api/applications will return a JSON object of all applications for that user

You can paginate the endpoint using the query string `?_page=2&_limit=5` you must return 5 new applications every time the load more button is clicked, `_page=` is the page you will be returning and `_limit=` is number of applications to return

Meta data on the applications can be found on the `Link` header on any paginated response.

see attached [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/5NOBLAgL17n4qoR82vhYY5/iwoca---frontend-developer.-test?node-id=0%3A1&t=EMSHOn1fDlCrdgaC-1) for how this should look

1. There is a pre styled `<Button />` component you can use for this.
1. Any comments you want to pass along to the reviewer add to [COMMENTS.md](./COMMENTS.md) and commit
1. To submit either send us a link to your public fork or another public repo. Alternatively you can zip up your files minus `node_modules` and email it over.

### Notes

- We consider tests important here at iwoca. Jest/Vitest are our preferred way of writing them, but you can use cypress or another library if more comfortable. This exercise uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). It offers a very similar API to Jest with additional performance gains.
- Feel free to alter the technologies used in the code base, eg. we use CSS modules but if you are more comfortable with `styled-components` for example you can install and use that for your portion of the task.
- Attention to detail in the design will go a long way.
- The task focusses mainly on desktop but we would be very happy to see mobile considered.
- Remember to check your project runs before submitting. - we will be running it in development mode to review.
- Feel free to refactor the code where appropriate.
